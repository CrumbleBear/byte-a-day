Hello there, and thanks for checking out my repository. In this repository, I will try to post something every day for the next few weeks at least. However, since I do have a life, I need to live it, and so over the weekend, I may work on stuff but might not post.

I am doing this challenge to improve myself in what I do. I really hope you find this helpful and can take some software away with you to use in your own projects. The first few projects are ones that I use and find useful, so they may not be the type to add to a project, but they can still be used "out of the box." If you stick around for a bit, there will probably be some useful stuff that can be added to other projects. Thanks for taking the time to read this :)
